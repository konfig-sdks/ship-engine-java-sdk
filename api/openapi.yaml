    ShipEngine's easy-to-use REST API lets you manage all of your shipping needs without worrying about the complexities of different carrier APIs and protocols. We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on providing a first-class shipping experience for your customers at the best possible prices.

    Each of ShipEngine's features can be used by itself or in conjunction with each other to build powerful shipping functionality into your application or service.

    ## Getting Started
    If you're new to REST APIs then be sure to read our [introduction to REST](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rest/) to understand the basics.  Learn how to [authenticate yourself to ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/), and then use our [sandbox environment](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/sandbox/) to kick the tires and get familiar with our API. If you run into any problems, then be sure to check the [error handling guide](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/errors/) for tips.

    Here are some step-by-step **tutorials** to get you started:

      - [Learn how to create your first shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/)
      - [Calculate shipping costs and compare rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/)
      - [Track packages on-demand or in real time](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/)
      - [Validate mailing addresses anywhere on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/)


    ## Shipping Labels for Every Major Carrier
    ShipEngine makes it easy to [create shipping labels for any carrier](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/) and [download them](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/downloading/) in a [variety of file formats](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/formats/). You can even customize labels with your own [messages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/messages/) and [images](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/branding/).


    ## Real-Time Package Tracking
    With ShipEngine you can [get the current status of a package](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) or [subscribe to real-time tracking updates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/webhooks/) via webhooks. You can also create [custimized tracking pages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/branded-tracking-page/) with your own branding so your customers will always know where their package is.


    ## Compare Shipping Costs Across Carriers
    Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [comparing rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/get-shipment-rates/) using the ShipEngine Rates API. Or if you don't know the full shipment details yet, then you can [get rate estimates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/estimate/) with limited address info.


    ## Worldwide Address Validation
    ShipEngine supports [address validation](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/) for virtually [every country on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/countries/), including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others.

    Shipments are at the center of the ShipEngine API.  A shipment is the first step in [creating a shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/), or [creating a manifest](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/shipping/manifests/).  It's also essential for [getting shipping rates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/).

    [Webhooks](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/webhooks/) are a powerful feature of ShipEngine that can save you from sending repeated polling requests to check on the state of something.  With webhooks, ShipEngine will automatically contact your servers when the stage changes.  This can include [parcel tracking](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) events, notification of the completion of a [batch operation](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/bulk/),  or new [salses orders](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/orders/).

      Batches are an advanced feature of ShipEngine designed for users who need to generate hundreds or thousands of labels at a time.
      When ShipEngine generates labels it relies on many carriers, their services, their dependencies, and a number of other variables
      to fulfill your requests; those requests can take a few minutes for us to get back to you.

      Webhooks allow the ShipEngine servers to contact your servers when an operation changes state, such as a batch label creation completion.

        This endpoint returns a list of labels that you've [created](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/). You can optionally filter the results as well as control their sort order and the number of results returned at a time.

        By default, all labels are returned, 25 at a time, starting with the most recently created ones.  You can combine multiple filter options to narrow-down the results.  For example, if you only want to get your UPS labels for your east coast warehouse you could query by both `warehouse_id` and `carrier_id`

      Many manifests are sent electronically to the carrier when you create a label, and
      often physical manifests are not necessary. Carriers receive the package details, shipping date,
      and other information that help them plan your package's delivery when you create a label.

      However, some providers, like USPS require manifests when shipping large numbers of packages. Think about how long it would take for a delivery driver to arrive, pick up 100 packages, and individually scan each of them.

      A manifest exists so the carrier can scan the manifest and check in all the packages being shipped.

      Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails, SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's shipment-recognition API helps you extract meaningful shipping data (people's names, addresses, package weights and dimensions, insurance and delivery requirements, etc.) from this unstructured text.

        The shipment-recognition API makes it easy for you to extract shipping data from unstructured text, including people's names, addresses, package weights and dimensions, insurance and delivery requirements, and more.

        Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails, SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's shipment-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data from this unstructured text. The parsed shipment data is returned in the same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, so you can easily use the parsed data to create a shipping label.

        > **Note:** Shipment recognition is currently supported for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

            The normalized value of the entity.

            Most entity results have a `value` field, which is the normalized value of the entity.  For example, if the substring "john doe" was recognized as a "person" entity, then the value might be normalized to have proper capitalization (e.g. "John Doe").  Or if the substring "ft worth" was recognized as a "city" entity, then the value might be normalized to "Fort Worth".

            Some entities have other information in addition to, or instead of a `value`.  For example, a "dimensions" entity will have separate fields for `length`, `width`, `height`, and `unit`.
